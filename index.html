          <p>
            he death of rapper Kiernan Jarryd Forbes, known as AKA,
             has left South Africans across the country reeling, 
             not only due to the violent nature of his passing, 
             but also the abrupt loss of such an iconic figure 
             in the local music industry. Forbes, along with his 
             long-time friend and former manager, Tebello “Tibz” Motsoane,
              was gunned down outside a restaurant on Florida Road in Morningside, 
              Durban, on Friday. The rapper had only recently celebrated his 35th birthday. 
              His newest album, Mass Country, was set for release on 24 February.
